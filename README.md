This is the benchmarking suite for our CSCE 569 Project.


### How to build the code

Just run `make` to run the whole benchmark suite.


### How to interpret the data

Each "suite" of tests generates a CSV file containing the results from the benchmark test.

The exact format of the CSV files has not been determined yet. Any updates to the format(s) will be recorded here.
